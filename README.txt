You may not use "Gotham Gazette" or "Balance!" in the name of any games you create using this software. We'd love it if you let players know that you were inspired by Gotham Gazette's Balance! but you have to come up with your own name for your game. We realize that the word "balance" is probably hard to avoid in naming games about balancing budgets. If you want to request permission to use "balance" in your game's name, please contact us.
